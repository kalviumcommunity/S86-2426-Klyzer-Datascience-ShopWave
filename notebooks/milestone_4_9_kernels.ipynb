    "Think of it as:\n",
    "- The **memory** where variables are stored\n",
    "- The **execution environment** that runs your Python code\n",
    "- The **state** that persists between cell executions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Variables remain in memory until the kernel is restarted\n",
    "- Cells can be run in any order, which can cause confusion\n",
    "- Restarting the kernel clears all variables and state\n",
    "- A busy kernel is executing code; an idle kernel is waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look at the top-right of your notebook:** You'll see a circle indicator:\n",
