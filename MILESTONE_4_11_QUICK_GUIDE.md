## Video Recording Checklist (~2 minutes)

### Part 1: Show Root Folder (15 sec)
- [ ] Open File Explorer to project root
- [ ] Explain: "This is the root of our Data Science project"
- [ ] List the main folders visible:
  - `data/`
  - `notebooks/`
  - `src/`
  - `outputs/`
  - `docs/`

### Part 2: Explain data/ folder (30 sec)
- [ ] Open `data/` folder
- [ ] Show `raw/` and `processed/` subfolders
- [ ] Explain:
  - "`raw/` stores original, unmodified data - NEVER edit these files"
  - "`processed/` stores cleaned data generated by scripts"
  - "This separation prevents accidental data corruption"

### Part 3: Explain notebooks/ folder (15 sec)
- [ ] Show `notebooks/` folder
- [ ] Point out the milestone notebooks
- [ ] Explain: "Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and documentation"

### Part 4: Explain src/ folder (15 sec)
- [ ] Show `src/` folder
- [ ] Explain: "Reusable Python scripts and functions"
- [ ] Mention: "Separate from notebooks for code reusability"

### Part 5: Explain outputs/ folder (20 sec)
- [ ] Show `outputs/` folder
- [ ] Show `figures/` and `reports/` subfolders
- [ ] Explain: 
  - "`figures/` for plots and visualizations"
  - "`reports/` for generated reports"
  - "Keeps results organized and separate from source data"

### Part 6: Explain docs/ folder (10 sec)
- [ ] Show `docs/` folder
- [ ] Explain: "Project documentation, data dictionaries, methodology notes"

### Part 7: Why This Matters (15 sec)
- [ ] "Good structure prevents confusion and lost files"
- [ ] "Makes collaboration easy"
- [ ] "Supports reproducibility"
- [ ] "Scales as projects grow"

## Video Script Suggestion

**Opening (5 sec):**
"Let me show you the Data Science project folder structure I've created."

**Root Overview (10 sec):**
"Here's the project root. We have five main folders: data, notebooks, src, outputs, and docs. Each has a specific purpose that keeps our work organized."

**Data Folder (30 sec):**
"The data folder has two subfolders. 'raw' stores original, unmodified datasets - we never edit files here. It's read-only source data. 'processed' stores cleaned and transformed datasets that are ready for analysis. This separation is critical - it prevents accidental data corruption and maintains data integrity."

**Notebooks Folder (15 sec):**
"Notebooks folder contains our Jupyter notebooks. You can see the milestone notebooks we've been working on. This is where we do exploratory analysis, visualization, and document our findings."

**Src Folder (15 sec):**
"Src contains reusable Python scripts. When we write functions that we use across multiple notebooks, we put them here. This keeps code modular and testable."

**Outputs Folder (20 sec):**
"Outputs has two subfolders. 'figures' stores all our plots and visualizations. 'reports' stores generated reports and summaries. By separating outputs from source data, we keep results organized and make it clear what can be regenerated."

**Docs Folder (10 sec):**
"Docs contains project documentation - things like data dictionaries, methodology notes, and meeting notes."

**Why It Matters (15 sec):**
"This structure prevents confusion, makes collaboration seamless, supports reproducibility, and scales as our project grows. Good organization is just as important as good code in data science."

**Closing (10 sec):**
"That's the standard Data Science project structure - clean, logical, and professional."

## Key Points to Emphasize

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Data** (raw vs processed)
- **Code** (notebooks vs scripts)
- **Results** (figures vs reports)
- **Documentation** (guides and notes)

### 2. Data Integrity
- Raw data stays untouched
- Processed data is regenerable
- Clear transformation trail

### 3. Reproducibility
- Clear file organization
- Predictable paths
- Easy to rerun processes

### 4. Collaboration
- Intuitive structure
- Self-documenting folders
- Easy for teammates to navigate

### 5. Scalability
- Handles growing complexity
- Easy to add new components
- Maintains clarity

## Folder Purpose Summary

| Folder | Purpose | Key Rule |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `data/raw/` | Original data | NEVER modify |
| `data/processed/` | Cleaned data | Generated by scripts |
| `notebooks/` | Analysis & exploration | Document with Markdown |
| `src/` | Reusable code | Modular functions |
| `outputs/figures/` | Visualizations | High-res images |
| `outputs/reports/` | Generated reports | Final summaries |
| `docs/` | Documentation | Guides and notes |

## Common Questions to Address

**Q: Why separate raw and processed data?**
A: Preserves data integrity, enables reproducibility, prevents accidental corruption

**Q: Why have src/ separate from notebooks/?**
A: Reusability, testability, production-ready code vs exploration

**Q: What if I have temporary files?**
A: Don't commit them. Use .gitignore or a temp/ folder (not tracked)

**Q: How deep should folder nesting go?**
A: Keep it simple. 2-3 levels max for most projects

**Q: Should I commit data files to git?**
A: Usually no - use .gitignore. Commit small samples only.

## Tips for Recording

### Before Recording:
1. **Open File Explorer** to project root
2. **Close unnecessary windows**
3. **Increase folder icon size** for visibility
4. **Have the structure diagram** ready if needed

### During Recording:
1. **Navigate slowly** through folders
2. **Pause briefly** at each folder
3. **Read folder names clearly**
4. **Explain as you show**
5. **Keep it under 2 minutes**

### What to Show:
- ✅ Folder structure (tree view)
- ✅ Purpose of each folder
- ✅ Subfolders (raw/processed, figures/reports)
- ✅ README files in folders
- ✅ Why organization matters

### What NOT to Show:
- ❌ Opening every README file
- ❌ Detailed file contents
- ❌ Unrelated folders
- ❌ Too much technical detail

---

## Alternative: Use Tree Command

You can show structure using terminal:

```powershell
# In PowerShell
tree /F

# Or for cleaner output
tree /A
```

This gives a nice visual tree of your structure!
