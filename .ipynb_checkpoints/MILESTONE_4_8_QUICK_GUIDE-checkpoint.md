## Video Recording Checklist (~2 minutes)

### Part 1: Show a Code Cell (30 sec)
- [ ] Point to a Code cell in the notebook
- [ ] Explain: "This is a Code cell - it executes Python"
- [ ] Run the cell (Shift + Enter)
- [ ] Show the output below the cell

### Part 2: Show a Markdown Cell (30 sec)
- [ ] Point to a Markdown cell
- [ ] Explain: "This is Markdown - it's for explanation, not execution"
- [ ] Double-click to edit it (shows raw Markdown)
- [ ] Press Shift + Enter to render it

### Part 3: Switch Cell Types (30 sec)
- [ ] Click on a Code cell
- [ ] Show the dropdown that says "Code" or "Markdown"
- [ ] Change it to Markdown, press Shift + Enter
- [ ] Change it back to Code
- [ ] Explain: "You can switch types depending on what you need"

### Part 4: Create New Cells (30 sec)
- [ ] Click between cells or at the end
- [ ] Press **B** to create a cell below (or use + button)
- [ ] Make it Markdown, write something like "# My New Section"
- [ ] Render it (Shift + Enter)
- [ ] Create a Code cell, write `print("Testing!")`
- [ ] Run it

## When to Use Each Type

### Use Code Cells For:
✅ Executing Python statements  
✅ Calculations and operations  
✅ Importing libraries  
✅ Data loading and processing  

### Use Markdown Cells For:
✅ Explaining what code will do  
✅ Interpreting results  
✅ Creating section headers  
✅ Documenting methodology

## Video Script Suggestion

**Opening (5 sec):**
"In this video, I'll demonstrate Code vs Markdown cells in Jupyter."

**Code Cell Demo (25 sec):**
"This is a Code cell. It contains Python code that executes when I run it. Watch - I'll press Shift + Enter... and you see the output below."

**Markdown Cell Demo (25 sec):**
"This is a Markdown cell. It's for explanation, not execution. If I double-click it, you see the raw Markdown. When I press Shift + Enter, it renders as formatted text."

**Switching Types (25 sec):**
"I can switch between types using this dropdown. Watch - I'll change this Code cell to Markdown... now it won't execute. I'll change it back to Code."

**Creating Cells (25 sec):**
"To create new cells, I press B for below. I'll make this one Markdown, add a heading... render it. Now a Code cell with a print statement... run it."

**Closing (10 sec):**
"Code cells execute, Markdown cells explain. Use both to create professional, readable notebooks."

## Important Reminders

- **Markdown cells don't execute** - they just display text
- **Code cells show output** below after running
- **Separate explanation from execution** for clean notebooks
- **Use # for comments in Code**, headings in Markdown
